# Trends in Bilingualism

A little project on looking into trends in Bilingualism from 1980 - 2023.

I will use the PubMed API to get titles of all publications from their database for the keyword "bilingual*" and create a word cloud per decade to get an idea of trends i bilingualism research.

![20202s](https://github.com/dmnkfr/bilingual_clouds/blob/main/output/2020s.png?raw=true)

To run your own query and create a word cloud for each decade, run:

`python main.py -e <email> -q <query> -s <stopwords>`
